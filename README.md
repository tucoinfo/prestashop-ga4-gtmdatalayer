This repository is a needed part for getting the Google Tag Manager tracking conversions correctly in 
PrestaShop. 

## add page view transaction tracking to your shop
Adding page view tracking is super simple. Adding conversion tracking requires a data layer, which I added with this module.

IMPORTANT: For this code to fire, your payment method modules need to be calling PrestaShop after payment. E.g. here are the changes I needed to make to get this to happen with PayPal. As far as I can tell, this "problem" exists for both my module, and for the PrestaShop Google Analytics module.

Install the PrestaShop module "Data Layer Module" (instructions for installing a PrestaShop module can be found in the PrestaShop Documentation). 
It's a VERY basic module that any PHP coder can understand and expand on.

In short, grab the Zip, rename the folder inside, upload via the BO.
